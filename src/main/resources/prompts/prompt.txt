As a User Story Quality Auditor, Classify the following user stories based on one of these user story problems and provide a corrected version with an explanation, Ensure the classification is accurate, selects the most prominent issue if multiple apply, and strictly follows the JSON format and example patterns.
Problems:
0: No problem - The user story is clear, concise, and properly structured with a defined role, action, and user-focused rationale.
1: User Stories Conflate Problems with Solutions - Too much detail, locks developers into a specific implementation
2: Misplaced Requirements - The “so that…” section should describe the rationale, not additional requirements 
3: Ultra-Huge Story - Too broad. If there are a lot of “ands” or “ors, consider breaking down to multiple stories
4: Technical User Story - Beware of user stories where “so that” is a technical capability, not of any value to the end user.
5: Poorly Defined User Roles - “Roles may be too vague, not giving enough information (e.g as a user) or roles can be too specific. Two roles that should be combined can give duplicate user stories
6: Parakeet Value - Beware when the “so that” phrase is a restatement of the “I want” phrase
Return the output as a JSON object with fields: us_id, estimated_problem_id, corrected_us, optional_explanation.
Examples:
Input: us_id: us1, us_text: As a customer, I want to use a drag-and-drop interface to design my own website layout so that I can create a professional website without coding.
Output: 
 {
  "us_id": "us1",
  "estimated_problem_id": 1,
  "corrected_us": "As a customer, I want to design my own website layout so that I can create a professional website without coding.",
  "optional_explanation": "1 was selected because the user story specifies a drag-and-drop interface, a solution rather than the core need (designing a website layout). The corrected user story removes the specific implementation to focus on the user’s goal."
}

Input: us_id: us2, us_text: As a teacher, I want to upload assignments and grade them online so that students can submit their work digitally and receive feedback quickly.
Output: 
{
"us_id": "us2",
"estimated_problem_id": 2,
"corrected_us": "As a teacher, I want to upload and grade assignments so that I can manage student work efficiently.",
"optional_explanation": "2 was selected because the 'so that' clause includes additional requirements (digital submission and quick feedback) instead of a clear rationale. The corrected user story focuses on the teacher’s efficiency."
}

Input: us_id: us3, us_text: As a manager, I want to track employee performance, generate reports, schedule meetings, and send reminders so that I can manage my team efficiently.
Output: 
{
  "us_id": "us3",
  "estimated_problem_id": 3,
  "corrected_us": "As a manager, I want to track employee performance so that I can manage my team efficiently.",
  "optional_explanation": "3 was selected because the user story is too broad, combining multiple unrelated tasks (tracking performance, generating reports, scheduling meetings, sending reminders). The corrected user story focuses on one key task to make it more manageable."
}

Input: us_id: us4, us_text: As a developer, I want to implement a REST API with JSON responses so that the system supports scalable data exchange.
Output: 
{
"us_id": "us4",
"estimated_problem_id": 4,
"corrected_us": "As a system user, I want to exchange data with the system so that I can access information seamlessly.",
"optional_explanation": "4 was selected because the user story focuses on a technical implementation (REST API with JSON responses) rather than user value. The corrected user story reframes it from a user’s perspective, emphasizing seamless data access."
}
---
Input: us_id: us5, us_text: As a user, I want to access the app quickly so that I can get my tasks done.
Output: 
{
  "us_id": "us5",
  "estimated_problem_id": 5,
  "corrected_us": "As an authenticated user, I want to access the app quickly so that I can complete my tasks efficiently.",
  "optional_explanation": "5 was selected because the role 'user' is too vague, lacking context about the user’s role or needs. The corrected user story specifies 'authenticated user' to clarify the role while maintaining focus on quick access."
}
---
Input: us_id: us6, us_text: As a shopper, I want to browse products easily so that I can find items quickly.
Output: 
{
"us_id": "us6",
"estimated_problem_id": 6,
"corrected_us": "As a shopper, I want to browse products easily so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.",
"optional_explanation": "6 was selected because the 'so that' clause restates the goal of browsing products (finding items quickly) rather than providing a distinct rationale. The corrected user story provides a clearer rationale focused on informed decisions."
}
---
Input: us_id: us7, us_text: As a parent, I want to monitor my child’s coding progress so that I can support their learning.
Output: 
{
  "us_id": "us7",
  "estimated_problem_id": 0,
  "corrected_us": "As a parent, I want to monitor my child’s coding progress so that I can support their learning.",
  "optional_explanation": "0 was selected because the user story is clear, concise, and properly structured. It defines a specific role (parent), a focused action (monitor coding progress), and a user-centered rationale (support learning). No correction is needed as it adheres to good user story practices."
